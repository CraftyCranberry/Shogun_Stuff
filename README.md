# Shogun Stuff
This repository contains the model of TVS-Suzuki Shogun's manifold along with other useful material I've managed to collect for this motorcycle over the years. 

After 3D scanning the actual manifold, I reverse-engineered the part from the 3D scan, using it as a reference for the various planes needed to develop an accurate 3D mockup.

Before I get into the files, here are some cool lil photos I took recently :)

### Here's a list of files in here:
- STL Model of the inlet manifold
- The SolidWorks part file of the inlet manifold (So you can edit it for custom variations of the manifold)
- Service Manual
- Owners Manual
- Parts Catalog
