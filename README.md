# Shogun Stuff
This repository contains the model of TVS-Suzuki Shogun's manifold along with other useful material I've managed to collect for this motorcycle over the past few years. 

After 3D scanning the actual manifold, I reverse-engineered the part from the 3D scan, using it as a reference for the various planes needed to develop an accurate 3D mockup.

Before I get into the files, here are some cool lil photos I took recently :)

## The 3D Scan
Here's a comparison of the actual manifold I scanned, vs the output from the 3D scan, along with the model that was recreated.

## The files
Here's a list of files in here:
- STL Model of the inlet manifold
- The SolidWorks part file of the inlet manifold (Coming later)
- Service Manual
- Owners Manual
- Parts Catalog
- Some other Miscellaneous stuff
- Will probably add more stuff in the future.
